# Recipe-Assistant
The Recipe Assistant is an application that aims to help a user find recipes within the limitations of their intolerances. For users who have many intolerances, attempting to find a recipe online that is possible to be eaten with their large amount of food intolerances is nearly impossible. Within the Recipe Assistant, a user may make a profile of their intolerances where when searching the system will vet and either hide or warn recipes that exceed those rules.
## Getting Started
The API for the Android application is currently offline, though a demo of the project recorded in its intended state with the API being online is linked below.
